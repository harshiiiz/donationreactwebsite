Created my first website using React.js with Stripe payment gateway integration.
There is a simple donate button,On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user
can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Visa, etc.
Once the payment is done ,invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. 
Completed this as TSF GRIP internship task#3.

Visit the website here : https://harshiiiz.github.io/donationreactwebsite . Click Home to land at the homepage.
 
Use this test card to make sure the payment gateway works. Use it with any CVC, postal code, and future expiration date.
